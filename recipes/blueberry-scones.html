            <li>1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons cold vegan butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup almond milk + more as needed</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ground flaxseeds, salt and sugar.</li>
            <li>Add the cold vegan butter, and use a pastry cutter or your hands to work the butter into the dry ingredients. It should resemble coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Pour in the milk and vanilla, and stir until just combined. If the dough seems too dry and crumbly, add up to another 1/4 cup of milk. Fold in the blueberries.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it comes together. Flatten the dough with your hands (lightly flour your hands if sticky). Flatten it into a circle, about 1 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Using a pizza cutter or large knife, cut it like you would a pizza, into 8 pieces.
            Place the scones onto the prepared baking sheet and bake for 22-26 minutes, until lightly golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>Make the optional glaze:
                <li>Combine the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. If the glaze is too thick, add more milk. If too thin, add more powdered sugar.</li>
                <li>Let the scones cool for at least 15 minutes, then drizzle some of the glaze onto each scone. Let the glaze set before serving.</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
