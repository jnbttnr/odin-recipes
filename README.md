# Odin Recipes
##  An _Odin Project_ HTML Exercise

The purpose of this assignment is to practice using HTML and git commands to build a simple recipe website. <br/>

There will likely be many commits \(this is part of the practice!\) and I'm sure I'll appear messy, but such is learning. <br/>

I'll come back and update this README with lessons learned and other pertinent info as the project develops.
